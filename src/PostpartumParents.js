        <p>Postpartum depression and anxiety are the most common complications of pregnancy.  One in seven new moms meets criteria for postpartum depression, 
            which often co-occurs with anxiety. Many mothers feel that something is wrong, but don’t speak up or ask for help. Unfortunately, maternal depression 
            is underscreened in doctor offices, leaving many mothers to suffer in silence without understanding what’s going on. There are many factors that 
            contribute to depression and anxiety--hormones, sleep scarcity, lack of support, epigenetic predispositions, etc--the symptoms are NEVER the mother’s 
            fault. However, they do need attention and getting treatment can help make a u-turn sooner rather than later. If depression and anxiety go untreated, 
            they usually get worse over time and can make parenting (and life in general) much more difficult than it has to be.</p>

        <p>The good news is that there is a lot you can do to help prevent postpartum depression and anxiety or reverse it in its tracks.  The pre and postpartum 
            time is an optimal window to take care of new or pre-existing depression and anxiety, while the family is still in the early stages of adjusting to the 
            new baby.The best gift you can give to your family is your mental health.</p>
