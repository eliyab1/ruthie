<h3>About Group Therapy</h3>
<p>Group therapy can be a helpful adjunct to individual therapy. Whereas individual therapy can help you countenance yourself, a group can help you countenance your relationships through practice in the here-and-now process.  Given that most psychological injuries happen in relationships, relationships in the safety of a therapy group have
     tremendous power to heal those injuries.  
    There is a magic healing power that happens in groups that brings out people’s best authentic selves, which they can carry over into their families, jobs, friends, etc.</p>
<ul> 
<li>Some unique aspects of group therapy include:*</li>
<li>Group cohesiveness: Getting together to share experiences builds a sense of connection and solidarity.</li>
<li>Universality: Being with others in the same boat can help you feel validated and realize that you’re not the only one with such struggles. Feeling less alone can give you hope and strength.</li>
<li>Interpersonal learning: Observing others, getting feedback about yourself, and learning practical information from others can help you be more open towards yourself and others.</li>
<li>Instilling hope: Hearing from others that things can get better can give you hope for your situation.</li>
<li>Imparting information: You may learn and share helpful information in the group.</li>
<li>Corrective recapitulation of the primary family group: Underlying relational patterns that were programmed early on, inevitably play out in group dynamics. Working through the patterns in a constructive new way in the here-and-now can be incredibly powerful.</li>
<li>Catharsis: A group environment can lend itself to emotional breakthroughs and resolution of repressed emotions.</li>
<li>Altruism: Group members have an opportunity to take care of each other and go beyond themselves to maximize the benefit for everyone in group.</li>
<li>Development of Socializing Techniques: Healthy interaction in the here-and-now paired with processing the interactions can help group members understand how they affect others and how others affect them.</li>
<li>Imitative Behavior: Group members can learn positive behaviors by emulating each other and set adaptive new patterns in motion.</li>
<li>Existentialism: Balancing freedom with responsibility, caring for yourself and others at the same time, finding meaning in the mundane, and overcoming fears by taking risks, can help you feel more empowered and centered.</li>
