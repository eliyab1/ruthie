        <h2><u>Getting Started</u></h2><br />
            <h3> We start with a free no-obligation phone consultation to discuss your reasons and expectations for therapy to determine if we would be a good fit for working together.</h3>
            <h3> The first appointment includes a discussion about informed consent,  assessment, and goal-setting.  The focus of this appointment is to join forces in understanding the difficulties you are experiencing and to arrive at a consensus about your goals and the steps needed to reach them.   Appointments are 50 minutes in length, unless we agree otherwise.</h3><br /><br />
 
        <h2><u>Working Together</u></h2><br />
            <h3>Throughout treatment I will remain active, supportive, and practical. To accelerate treatment, I use evidence-based methods to help you build emotional capacity to let go of self-defeating behaviors in order to access and work through the feelings that are causing your distress so that you can experience greater emotional freedom and symptom resolution.  To this effect, I will challenge you in identifying  behaviors that are unhelpful to you and encourage you to turn toward healthier ways of relating with yourself and others. Since having a strong alliance is essential for  therapeutic success, I encourage you to provide ongoing honest feedback  about what is working for you and what is not so that we can make the necessary changes.</h3>
            <h3>If we agree that you could benefit from additional appointments, we  can discuss the frequency and duration to best suit your needs.</h3>
