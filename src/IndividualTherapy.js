            <h3>Throughout treatment I will remain active, supportive, and practical. To accelerate treatment, I use evidence-based methods to help you build emotional capacity to let go of self-defeating behaviors in order to access and work through the feelings that are causing your distress so that you can experience greater emotional freedom and symptom resolution.  To this effect, I will challenge you in identifying  behaviors that are unhelpful to you and encourage you to turn toward healthier ways of relating with yourself and others. Since having a strong alliance is essential for  therapeutic success, I encourage you to provide ongoing honest feedback  about what is working for you and what is not so that we can make the necessary changes.</h3>
            <h3>If we agree that you could benefit from additional appointments, we  can discuss the frequency and duration to best suit your needs.</h3>
