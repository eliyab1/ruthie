        <p>Getting Started
We start with a free no-obligation phone consultation to discuss your reasons and expectations for therapy to determine if we would be a good fit for working together.
The first appointment includes a discussion about informed consent,  assessment, and goal-setting.  The focus of this appointment is to join forces in understanding the difficulties you are experiencing and to arrive at a consensus about your goals and the steps needed to reach them.   Appointments are 50 minutes in length, unless we agree otherwise.
 
Working Together
 
Throughout treatment I will remain active, supportive, and practical. To accelerate treatment, I use evidence-based methods to help you build emotional capacity to let go of self-defeating behaviors in order to access and work through the feelings that are causing your distress so that you can experience greater emotional freedom and symptom resolution.  To this effect, I will challenge you in identifying  behaviors that are unhelpful to you and encourage you to turn toward healthier ways of relating with yourself and others. Since having a strong alliance is essential for  therapeutic success, I encourage you to provide ongoing honest feedback  about what is working for you and what is not so that we can make the necessary changes.
 
 
If we agree that you could benefit from additional appointments, we  can discuss the frequency and duration to best suit your needs.
