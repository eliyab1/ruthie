    return <><p>Welcome to Mental Fitness Therapy, where we build emotional muscles and psychological flexibility for a healthy and
         happy life. Getting into shape, both physically and mentally, requires some initial concerted effort, but with practice the 
         process becomes organic and enjoyable.Think of therapy as your mental wellness gym, a space where you can set goals, learn 
         about yourself, get active, practice new skills, experiment with new behaviors, challenge yourself, reward yourself, 
         and transform.
