                <h3>Welcome to Mental Fitness Therapy, where we build emotional muscles and psychological flexibility for a healthy and
                    happy life. Getting into shape, both physically and mentally, requires some initial concerted effort, but with practice the 
                    process becomes organic and enjoyable.</h3>
                    <h3>Think of therapy as your mental wellness gym, a space where you can set goals, learn 
                    about yourself, get active, practice new skills, experiment with new behaviors, challenge yourself, reward yourself, 
                    and transform.
